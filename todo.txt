- show where you have rental agreements
x speaking to neighbors broken
- maybe too much energy?

x rent print is wrong
x confusing trade lists offers "at c2"
- double max appeared after long distance move maybe?
-- move plan account for hoverboard/jump

- patrick hosts on a linux server
-? patrick's cancel trade error msg
- most meditative
- bring back individual's lvt payments (stats are fun!?)
- a 'new season' pause that requires everyone to ready up or times out.
- let energy square stack
- look 'g' to see where g is on the map
- looking at player, but whose plans are they!?
- didn't format well for rabbit
- big map
- hm, simultaneous crafting/gathering the day someone builds fencing problematic
- add and remove bots testing
- RENT command? to rent rental cubes or maybe other things...(if posted by landlord, won't be player-specific, if by renter, then yes)
x seizure immunity by offering resources for rent
- "here's how your day went" appears below the report of the day!
- immediately exiting couldn't find a user..oh maybe bc 'exit' is intercepted up top
- would like to make addToPlayerInboxByPlayerName not accessible in george.js somehow ayaya
- add this.playerDids for discord ids for rejoining purposes...maybe [{ pid, did, outbox }]
- check on game before joining
- make xerox work
- make pulpit work
- make trades expire...otherwise, gets spammy
- hmm...could make a viewing channel...and a betting game meta hahahahah
- pruning trades failed (or didn't happen until season?)
- view yesterday's report, view zot's yesterday's report 'plans yesterday' maybe. 'plans <zot name or #>'?
- or limit space on land for the building of improvements?
- and check your own land should draw map and show what you own...somehow (probably hide other zots)
- map of land owned
- thought he had to type "?" before all commands
- daily report should be cleaner, each player can save its yesterday, as metaplan
- detailed view: utilized all three columns...


- sell daily-computer code to bio fence?
- energycube (longer lasting) (could set rent? only rent-able?) (make esquares depreciate more on use) (how to priotize usage?)
// make a separate list for mobile

other:
- accept full resource name where accepting res code
- align the description printouts when you ? <command>
- add better start game spacing
- other scoreboards: chattiest, attackiest
- hide where you plan to be if no plans to move or say "no moves planned" and "no plans made" separtely below
- spacing on '? trade' is off 

good:
- landgrabbers
- crafting with items for super items
- limit improvements on a land maybe
- moaf synthesizer (maybe we make some other super plentiful resource that is not regenerated too?)
- need seeds or terraforming heheh

great:
- employment/rental
- other resources
- aliens + attacking
-x lasereye

low priority features:
- what about 'x' resources for wildcard
- caring for each other
- anomalies
- when you repeat an action, you get a bonus (economies of scale)
- cooperation benefits
- improving skills and specialization/starting skills
- exhaustion (trying to go negative energy penalty)
- king mode
- naming puppies or something
